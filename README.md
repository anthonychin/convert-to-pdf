#Converting a batch of powerpoint or word files to PDF

@version 1.0

The idea of this repository came from collecting all my previous school works. In the case I may need to access my old word documents / powerpoint for nostalgia purpose. Simply opening up a word file or powerpoint takes up too much time. Hence this script converts it to PDF file which shortens the load time.

This script converts an entire directory from doc/docx or ppt/pptx to pdf file.

##How to Use:
This script converts a single word/ppt file to pdf or converts an entire directory of doc/docx or ppt/pptx file from the current directory.

1) Move the script to your directory of the file(s) where you want it to be converted.

###Directory
SaveAsPDFWordBatch.js 
SaveAsPDFPPTBatch.js

###Single File
PPTSaveAsPDF.js
WordSaveAsPDF.js

Converting directory:
`$ cscript.exe //nologo SaveAsPDFWordBatch.js`

or

Converting a single word/ppt file:
`$ cscript.exe //nologo WordSaveAsPDF.js bla.doc`
